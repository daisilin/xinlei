I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Neuroscience at New York University. I am passionate about the intersection between machine learning and cognitive science. I work with [Dr. Wei Ji Ma](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/) studying how sequences of actions in complex environments are made in artificial intelligence and in humans. Currently my research projects focus on improving LLM planning and reasoning, improving deep reinforcement learning algorithms with cognitive model insights, using GPT models to predict human gameplay, studying the individual differences and of complex planning.

Besides doing research, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, baking desserts and playing with cats
