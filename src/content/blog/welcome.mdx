Hello! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts on AI research and the journey of building intelligent systems.

## What I'll Write About

This blog will cover topics I'm passionate about:

### AI Agents & Computer Use

Building agents that can reliably interact with the real world — especially user interfaces — is one of the most exciting frontiers in AI. I've been working on this problem at Amazon AGI, and there's so much to explore around how we can make these systems more robust, generalizable, and aligned with human intentions.

### Reinforcement Learning

RL is at the heart of my research. From my PhD work comparing human and machine planning, to training production models like [Nova Act](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/build-reliable-ai-agents-for-ui-workflow-automation-with-amazon-nova-act-now-generally-available/), I've seen how powerful — and challenging — RL can be. I'll share insights on what works, what doesn't, and where the field is heading.

### Human-AI Interaction

My background in computational neuroscience gives me a unique lens on AI. Understanding how humans plan and make decisions can inform how we build better AI systems. I'll write about the cognitive science perspective on intelligence.

### LLM Post-Training

Fine-tuning and RLHF are crucial for making language models useful and safe. I'll share thoughts on the craft of post-training and what makes models actually good at tasks.

## Why Write?

A few reasons:

1. **Thinking in public** — Writing forces clarity. It helps me understand what I actually know versus what I think I know.

2. **Building in public** — I want to share the messy reality of research, not just the polished papers.

3. **Connecting** — Some of the best collaborations come from putting ideas out there.

## Stay Tuned

I'll try to post regularly — probably a mix of technical deep-dives, research reflections, and occasional musings on the AI field.

Feel free to reach out if any of these topics resonate with you. I'm always happy to chat about AI agents, RL, or the future of intelligent systems.
